# kArmor

**kArmor** is a CLI client to help manage [KubeArmor](github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor).

KubeArmor is a container-aware runtime security enforcement system that
restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking
operation) of containers at the system level.

## Installation

The following sections show how to install the kArmor. It can be installed either from source, or from pre-built binary releases.

### From Script

kArmor has an installer script that will automatically grab the latest version of kArmor and install it locally.

```
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubearmor/kubearmor-client/main/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

The binary will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` folder.

### From Source 

Building kArmor from source is slightly more work, but is the best way to go if you want to test the latest (pre-release) kArmor version.

```
git clone https://github.com/kubearmor/kubearmor-client.git
cd kubearmor-client
make install
```
