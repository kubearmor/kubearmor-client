    tldr: Restrict access to trusted certificated bundles in the OS image
    detailed: Operating systems maintain a list of trusted certificates (often called
      trust bundles) in file system. These bundles decides which authorities are trusted.
      Subverting these trust controls would essentially allow an adversary to operate
      as a trusted entity. Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either
      warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
      Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs
      or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would
      include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code
      signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it
      has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an
      indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.

      of malicious code
    detailed: |-
      Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time.
      Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges).
